            The solver accepts two to four actions per player and represents
            every payoff and equilibrium probability as a normalized bigint
            fraction. Floating point does not enter an equilibrium or
            best-response correctness path.

          <p>
            Equal-size support enumeration returns all equilibria of a
            nondegenerate bimatrix game within that bound. Degenerate games can
            contain equilibrium components; the engine detects an exact
            support-size witness, reports pure equilibria and verified mixed
            samples, and does not call that sample complete.

            Match length, policy decisions, and action noise each receive an
            event-addressed stream derived from the master seed. Changing one
            policy therefore does not silently shift an opponent&apos;s future
            random draws.

            Evolution shares use guarded floating-point replicator updates.
            Those shares are simulation state, not solver claims. A zero or
            non-finite mean-fitness denominator returns a typed failure before
            division.
