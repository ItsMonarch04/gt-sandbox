  ruleExplainer:
    "Each generation, every cell plays the game against each of its neighbours, adds up what it earned, and then copies whichever cell in its neighbourhood scored highest. Everything happens at once: scores come from the previous lattice, so no cell sees a neighbour that has already changed.",
  whyItWorks:
    "Cooperators survive here without any memory, reputation, or punishment. A cluster of cooperators shields its own interior — the cells on the boundary lose to the defectors outside, but the cells inside meet only each other and keep earning. That is a fact about geometry, not about strategy.",
  exactness:
    "Every score below is an exact fraction and every cell an integer, so the lattice is bit-for-bit reproducible. That matters more than usual: the update rule turns on comparing two accumulated scores, and near the threshold those comparisons come down to differences that floating-point rounding would decide arbitrarily.",
  tieBreak:
    "When a cell ties with the best of its neighbours it keeps its own strategy. Without that rule a tied cell would flip every generation and the lattice would blink forever — an artefact of the tie-break rather than anything in the model.",
